# LatticeGFH90.jl

A [Julia](https://julialang.org/)/[Nemo](http://nemocas.org/) package to make lattices of compatibly embedded finite fields
based on Hilbert's theorem 90 and Allombert's algorithm.

## How to: install

### The Julia packages

- Install Julia (preferably the last version, to avoid suprises...)
- Type `]` to go in package mode (`Backspace` to quit)

```
(v1.1) pkg> add Nemo

(v1.1) pkg> add "https://github.com/erou/LatticeGFH90.jl"

julia> using Nemo, LatticeGFH90
```

- You're done!

**Note:** this has not been tested on a wide variety of systems, if you
encounter a problem during install, please tell us!
